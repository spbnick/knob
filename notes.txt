So, what if the relation reference has less roles than the one in the
database?

What if it has a subset of roles compared to multiple relations in the database?

Which one is it referencing then?

A relation with more roles inherits and overrides the attributes of the
relation with less roles, but only at render time and at access time

In which order does a relation inherit attributes from relations with the same
amount but different roles missing? Undefined. Don't do that.

Or should we just make a reference to a relation with less roles update
existing relations with more roles? And create relations with non existing set
of roles? Or perhaps we should always just create relations with non-existing
set of roles, at least for the start?

That sounds better.

FORMAT:

Taking inspiration from graphviz, but purely-data oriented, and with support
for relations (hypergraphs).

"<name>"
    - entity
<name>
    - entity

entity -[]-> entity
    - implicit relation with source and target

---
So, maybe if we have two items, like e.a.b, we say that a is type and b is
name. And if we have only one item, like e.b, we say that b is name and there
is no type, because you can have an entity without a type, but you cannot have
an entity without a name?

What about relations? There's just two cases: type or no type, so it's always
type.

But we could only figure that out when we actually use those, so perhaps we
better avoid that kind of complexity.
